    <h4>
        Description
    </h4>

    <p>
        Imagine behind so hot outside that you just want to stay inside,
         munching on some delicious food.
    </p>
    <p>
        Turning on the oven is out of question!
    </p>
    <p> 
        But what about some delicious, nutritious cold pasta?
    </p>
    <p>
        That's what we will be doing today!

    </p>

    <h4>
        Ingredients
    </h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of your favorite pasta</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise</li>
        <li>4 ounces of smoked salmon, shredded</li>
        <li>1/2 cup orange or yellow bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup celery, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup green onions (scallions), chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Pinch dried dill</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>
        Steps
    </h4>

    <ol>
        <li>ring a large pot of salted water to a boil (use a tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water). Add the pasta. Cook uncovered, at a rolling boil until al dente, or tender, but still a bit firm.
        Drain and rinse under cold water. (If you are making the pasta ahead of time, stir in a little olive oil to keep the pasta from sticking to each other.)
        Note that if you are using different kinds of pasta, you may want to cook them separately as different types of pasta cook at different rates.</li>
        <li>Adjust the amounts of mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste.
        Serve chilled or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
